    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for easy retrieval, manipulation, and management. It is designed to efficiently store and manage large amounts of information, allowing users to perform various operations such as storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, querying languages, and usage scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.They use SQL as a standardized language for managing and manipulating the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.They enforce strong consistency and provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.They are suitable for applications with complex relationships between data entities, where data integrity and consistency are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.NoSQL databases use various data models such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.They provide flexible schemas that allow for dynamic and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.They use different query languages or APIs depending on the database type (e.g., MongoDB uses a document-based query language).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.They often prioritize scalability, high availability, and distributed architectures over strong consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.They are well-suited for handling large-scale applications with rapidly changing data or where horizontal scalability is a requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the scalability requirements, the complexity of relationships, the need for consistency, and the specific use case of the application."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define and manipulate the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and so on. Here's an explanation of four common DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, or stored procedures. It defines the structure of the object and any associated attributes. For example, to create a table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement creates a table called \"Employees\" with three columns: \"ID\" (integer type and primary key), \"Name\" (variable-length string), and \"Salary\" (decimal number).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete an existing database object such as a table, view, or index. It permanently removes the object and all associated data. For example, to drop the \"Employees\" table created above, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement deletes the \"Employees\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or other attributes of a table. For example, to add a new column called \"Department\" to the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement adds a new column named \"Department\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. Unlike the DROP statement, which deletes the entire table, TRUNCATE only removes the data and resets any associated auto-increment values. For example, to remove all data from the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement deletes all rows from the \"Employees\" table but keeps the table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some common examples of how the CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE statements are used in DDL to define and manipulate the structure of a database."

    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to manipulate the data within a database. DML statements are used to insert, update, and delete data from database tables. Here's an explanation of three common DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table. It allows you to specify the values for each column or select them from another table. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement inserts a new row into the \"Employees\" table with the values 1 for ID, 'John Doe' for Name, and 5000 for Salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. It allows you to update one or more columns based on specified conditions. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement updates the \"Salary\" column of the \"Employees\" table, increasing it by 1000 for the employee with ID 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table based on specified conditions. It allows you to selectively delete data from a table. Here's an example:\n",

    "DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to retrieve data from a database. DQL statements, particularly the SELECT statement, are used to query the database and fetch specific data based on specified conditions. Here's an explanation of the SELECT statement with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify which columns to retrieve, apply filtering conditions, perform calculations, and even join multiple tables. Here's a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, \"column1\" and \"column2\" represent the names of the columns you want to retrieve data from, and \"table_name\" represents the name of the table.\n",

    "This statement selects the \"ID\" and \"Name\" columns from the \"Employees\" table, but only for the rows where the \"Department\" column is equal to 'Sales'. The result would be a list of IDs and names of employees in the Sales department.\n",

    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record (or row) in the table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data in the table. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two records in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Non-null: Primary key columns cannot contain null values. Every record must have a value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Indexing: Primary keys are typically indexed, which provides faster data retrieval and efficient enforcement of uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Table Identity: The primary key uniquely identifies a record within a table and allows you to differentiate one record from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Single/Multiple Columns: A primary key can consist of a single column or a combination of multiple columns, known as a composite primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, enforcing referential integrity. Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Relationship: A foreign key establishes a link between two tables by referencing the primary key column(s) of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Referential Integrity: Foreign keys ensure that data consistency is maintained across related tables. They enforce referential integrity rules, preventing orphaned or inconsistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Parent-Child Relationship: The table containing the foreign key is referred to as the child table, and the table with the corresponding primary key is referred to as the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Data Validation: Foreign keys validate that the values in the child table exist in the parent table's primary key column(s). They enforce the relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.CASCADE Actions: Foreign keys can be configured with actions such as CASCADE, which automatically performs related actions on child records when the parent record is updated or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Many-to-One Relationship: Foreign keys often represent a many-to-one relationship, where multiple records in the child table can refer to a single record in the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two tables: \"Employees\" and \"Departments.\" The \"Employees\" table may have a primary key column \"EmployeeID,\" and the \"Departments\" table may have a primary key column \"DepartmentID.\" To establish a relationship, the \"Employees\" table can have a foreign key column \"DepartmentID\" that refers to the \"Departments\" table's primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary key in the \"Departments\" table ensures each department has a unique ID, and the foreign key in the \"Employees\" table references the department to which an employee belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using primary keys and foreign keys, databases can establish relationships between tables, enforce data integrity, and ensure consistency in the data."

    "cursor(): The cursor() method creates a cursor object, which allows you to execute SQL statements and retrieve data from the database. It is a method provided by the MySQL Connector/Python library.\n",
    "\n",
